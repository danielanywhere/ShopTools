One of the biggest complaints I've heard about CNC routers in recent
years is that, even when you want to use your machine for simple ad-hoc
drills and cuts, the time it takes to plan everything out, draft it in
your favorite CAD application, and create your tool paths with a
matching CAM application often outweighs the convenience. You could have
saved time by just walking over to your traditional power tools and
doing it manually. But that's about to change…

Welcome to **ShopTools**, the application that finally makes CNC routing
easier than using your old power tools - except now, you don’t have to
touch those tools at all. That’s right: with no CAD, no CAM, no
expensive software or steep learning curve - you can just **drag,
drop,** and **cut**.

## Why ShopTools?

Have you ever wished your CNC router could just **replace** your power
tools instead of adding another layer of complexity? Well, **wish
granted**. ShopTools is here to make your CNC pay for itself by taking
over the following jobs.

-   **Drill Press**. Precisely placed holes, no measuring required.

-   **Table Saw / Miter Saw**. Straight cuts, perpendicular or at any
    angle.

-   **Band Saw**. Curve? No problem.

-   **Scroll Saw**. Intricate, detailed work with machine precision.

-   **Jigsaw / Sabre Saw**. For the times you just need a quick,
    accurate cut.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## How It Works

Imagine defining your cuts *faster than you could mark them with a
straightedge and pencil*. That’s what ShopTools delivers. No marking. No
CAD. No CAM. No tool-path configurations. You just accurately position
your material on the waste board, and your CNC does the rest.

-   **Use any numbering system**. Every measurement textbox supports
    every popular distance-type measurement expression. You can specify
    inches and fractions of an inch for one parameter, while using
    decimal inches or millimeters for another.

-   **Template-driven workflow**. Just drag and drop movements, drill
    positions, and cut lines into place.

-   **No job is too simple**. Even if you only need to drill one hole or
    make one cut, this is the perfect way to get it perfect the first
    time every time.

-   **Lines at any angle**. Set a couple of parameters and go.

-   **Save and reuse cut lists**. Open, edit, and export to G-code
    whenever you need.

-   **One-time table setup**. Just set your dimensions, directions of
    travel, and origins. Done.

-   **Check your cuts before exporting.** You can now review your cuts
    on a scale-model orthogonal 3D view of your table.

## The Safest Way to Run Your Shop

Why get your hands near a spinning blade when you don’t have to? With
ShopTools, the only time you touch the machine is when you’re
**calibrating it, turning it on,** or **turning it off**. Everything in
between is hands-free. Faster cuts, safer operation, and zero risk of
kick-back or touching rotating equipment.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## But Wait, There's More

Improvements are coming along pretty rapidly but if you encounter
something that hasn't been addressed, just add an Issue and we'll make
sure it gets some attention.

So, what’s stopping you? Your CNC is ready to go to work. **Why not let
it?**

### More Information

Since ShopTools Desktop is just a young application, it doesn't yet have
much of a world-wide reputation. As a result, Microsoft products like
Edge and Teams might warn you that since this application isn't
downloaded very much, you should make sure you trust it before
installing it. They will likely also cause you to take several
additional unnecessary steps to get the software installed to make sure
you really intend to place it on your PC.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Reporting the Setup File as Safe

If you have already learned to trust ShopTools and want to help build
its reputation so other users don't have to perform additional
installation steps, you can select the option to **Report this file as
safe** on the meatball menu next to the warning **ShopToolsSetup.exe
isn't commonly downloaded, make sure you trust ShopToolsSetup.exe before
you open it**.

When you select **Report this file as safe**, you are directed to the
Microsoft SmartScreen website where you can check **I think this is a
safe website**.

## Using ShopTools

The general workflow of using ShopTools is easy.

The following are the general steps for creating No-CAD / No-CAM cuts on
your CNC router:

-   Open ShopTools. If this is the first time opening the application,
    choose the **Edit / Settings** menu option to configure your table.
    This only needs to be done once.

-   Set the Length, Width, and Depth of your workpiece. Optionally,
    position the workpiece and router at known offsets.

-   Double-click a pattern or drag and drop it onto your work area, and
    set the properties like starting offset, length, angle, or whatever
    is applicable for the operation.

-   Repeat the above steps until all holes and cuts are defined.

-   Save your cut-list file if you wish to refer back to it later.
    Whenever you open a cut-list file you've saved earlier, you only
    need to export it to g-code to use it, skipping all of the above
    steps.

-   Export your file to g-code and pass that file to your machine.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

NOTE: Although the feature is planned, ShopTools doesn't yet have a
real-time 3D toolpath preview. If you like to review your toolpaths as a
general rule before sending them to your machine, I would recommend
using <https://ncviewer.com/> by ToolPath Labs.
