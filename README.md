One of the biggest complaints I've heard about CNC routers in recent
years is that even if you want to use your machine for simple ad-hoc
drills and cuts, by the time you get everything planned out, drafted
into your favorite CAD application, and configured with a matching CAM
application, you would've saved a lot of time to just have walked over
to your traditional power tools and had done it manually. That situation
is about to change...

Welcome to **ShopTools**, the application that finally makes CNC routing
easier than using your old power tools - except now, you don’t have to
touch those tools at all. That’s right: with no CAD, no CAM, no
expensive software or steep learning curve - you can just **drag,
drop,** and **cut**.

## Why ShopTools?

Have you ever wished your CNC router could just **replace** your power
tools instead of adding another layer of complexity? Well, **wish
granted**. ShopTools is here to make your CNC pay for itself by taking
over the following jobs.

-   **Drill Press**. Precisely placed holes, no measuring required.

-   **Table Saw / Miter Saw**. Straight cuts, perpendicular or at any
    angle.

-   **Band Saw**. Curve? No problem.

-   **Scroll Saw**. Intricate, detailed work with machine precision.

-   **Jigsaw / Sabre Saw**. For the times you just need a quick,
    accurate cut.

## How It Works

Imagine defining your cuts *faster than you could mark them with a
straightedge and pencil*. That’s what ShopTools delivers. No marking. No
CAD. No CAM. No tool-path configurations. You just accurately position
your material on the waste board, and your CNC does the rest.

-   **Use any numbering system**. Every measurement textbox supports
    every popular distance-type measurement expression. You can specify
    inches and fractions of an inch for one parameter, while using
    decimal inches or millimeters for another.

-   **Template-driven workflow**. Just drag and drop movements, drill
    positions, and cut lines into place.

-   **No job is too simple**. Even if you only need to drill one hole or
    make one cut, this is the perfect way to get it perfect the first
    time every time.

-   **Lines at any angle**. Set a couple of parameters and go.

-   **Save and reuse cut lists**. Open, edit, and export to G-code
    whenever you need.

-   **One-time table setup**. Just set your dimensions, directions of
    travel, and origins. Done.

## The Safest Way to Run Your Shop

Why get your hands near a spinning blade when you don’t have to? With
ShopTools, the only time you touch the machine is when you’re
**calibrating it, turning it on,** or **turning it off**. Everything in
between is hands-free. Faster cuts, safer operation, and zero risk of
kick-back or touching rotating equipment.
