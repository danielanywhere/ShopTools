# Release Notes - Version 25.2715.4228
Please see the associated GitHub Issues for more information on any of these entries.

## Alternative Download Available
We are currently having issues with the Microsoft SmartScreen system, which is causing our users to go through a number of unnecessary steps to get the normal file downloaded and installed.

If you have problems downloading **ShopToolsSetup.exe**, you can try the **ShopToolsPortable.zip** file.
 - Download **ShopToolsPortable.zip**.
 - Extract all files onto a folder.
 - Run **RunShopTools.cmd**

As with other executable downloads, you should right click the downloaded ZIP file, select **Properties**, check **Unblock**, then click **OK** before extracting the files to a directory in order to avoid the blue *Windows protected your PC* dialog.

## Bugs Fixed
 - Bug: Values in scientific notation are being misinterpreted

## Improvements Completed
 - Add SVG Import
